abstract = {A simple earth system model is developed to simulate global carbon and phosphorus cycling over the late Quaternary. It is focused on the geological cycling of C and P via continental weathering, volcanic and metamorphic degassing, hydrothermal processes and burial at the seabed. A simple ocean model is embedded in this geological model where the global ocean is represented by surface water, thermocline and deep water boxes. Concentrations of dissolved phosphorus, dissolved inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity are calculated for each box. The partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere (pCO2A) is determined by exchange processes with the surface ocean and the continents. It serves as key prognostic model variable and is assumed to govern surface temperatures and global sea-level. The model is formulated as autonomous system, in which the governing equations have no explicit time-dependence. For certain parameter values, the model does not converge towards a steady-state but develops stable self-sustained oscillations. These free oscillations feature pCO2A minima and maxima consistent with the ice-core record when vertical mixing in the ocean is allowed to vary in response to pCO2A-controlled temperature change. A stable 100-kyr cycle with a rapid transition from glacial to interglacial conditions is obtained when additional non-linear equations are applied to calculate deep ocean mixing, iron fertilization and the depth of organic matter degradation as function of pCO2A-controlled surface temperature. The $\delta$13C value of carbon in the ocean/atmosphere system calculated in these model runs is consistent with the benthic $\delta$13C record. However, the simulated 13C depletion in the glacial ocean is not driven by the decline in terrestrial carbon stocks but by sea-level change controlling the rates of organic carbon burial and weathering at continental margins. The pCO2A- and $\delta$13C oscillations develop without any form of external Milankovitch forcing. They are induced and maintained by sea-level change generating persistent imbalances in the marine carbon and phosphorus budgets. Stable oscillations are also obtained when sea-level change is allowed to lag temperature with a realistic time scale for ice-sheet adjustment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ice core measurements have revealed a highly asymmetric cycle in Antarctic temperature and atmospheric CO2 over the last 800 kyr. Both CO 2 and temperature decrease over 100 kyr going into a glacial period and then rise steeply over less than 10 kyr at the end of a glacial period. There does not yet exist wide agreement about the causes of this cycle or about the origin of its shape. Here we explore the possibility that an ecologically driven oscillator plays a role in the dynamics. A conceptual model describing the interaction between calcifying plankton and ocean alkalinity shows interesting features: (i) It generates an oscillation in atmospheric CO 2 with the characteristic asymmetric shape observed in the ice core record, (ii) the system can transform a sinusoidal Milankovitch forcing into a sawtooth-shaped output, and (iii) there are spikes of enhanced calcifier productivity at the glacial-interglacial transitions, consistent with several sedimentary records. This suggests that ecological processes might play an active role in the observed glacial-interglacial cycles. {\textcopyright}2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Ice sheets appeared in the northern hemisphere around 3 Ma (million years) ago and glacial--interglacial cycles have paced Earth's climate since then. Superimposed on these long glacial cycles comes an intricate pattern of millennial and sub-millennial variability, including Dansgaard--Oeschger and Heinrich events. There are numerous theories about these oscillations. Here, we review a number of them in order to draw a parallel between climatic concepts and dynamical system concepts, including, in particular, the relaxation oscillator, excitability, slow--fast dynamics and homoclinic orbits. Namely, almost all theories of ice ages reviewed here feature a phenomenon of synchronization between internal climate dynamics and astronomical forcing. However, these theories differ in their bifurcation structure and this has an effect on the way the ice age phenomenon could grow 3 Ma ago. All theories on rapid events reviewed here rely on the concept of a limit cycle excited by changes in the surface freshwater balance of the ocean. The article also reviews basic effects of stochastic fluctuations on these models, including the phenomenon of phase dispersion, shortening of the limit cycle and stochastic resonance. It concludes with a more personal statement about the potential for inference with simple stochastic dynamical systems in palaeoclimate science.},

abstract = {The consequences of the hypothesis that Milankovitch forcing affects the phase (e.g., termination times) of the 100 kyr glacial cycles via a mechanism known as "nonlinear phase locking" are examined. Phase locking provides a mechanism by which Milankovitch forcing can act as the "pacemaker" of the glacial cycles. Nonlinear phase locking can determine the timing of the major deglaciations, nearly independently of the specific mechanism or model that is responsible for these cycles as long as this mechanism is suitably nonlinear. A consequence of this is that the fit of a certain model output to the observed ice volume record cannot be used as an indication that the glacial mechanism in this model is necessarily correct. Phase locking to obliquity and possibly precession variations is distinct from mechanisms relying on a linear or nonlinear amplification of the eccentricity forcing. Nonlinear phase locking may determine the phase of the glacial cycles even in the presence of noise in the climate system and can be effective at setting glacial termination times even when the precession and obliquity bands account only for a small portion of the total power of an ice volume record. Nonlinear phase locking can also result in the observed "quantization" of the glacial period into multiples of the obliquity or precession periods. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {A new physical mechanism involving the Antarctic ice-sheet extent is able to link climatic and CO2 glacial-interglacial changes. It is furthermore able to explain many features of the glacial cycles, like the 100 kyr oscillations or the peculiarities of stage 11 (about 400 kyr BP). Indeed, from recent results, the glacial ocean bottom waters were possibly much more saline and consequently, may have an unsuspected large density. This glacial deep stratification could account for a significant part of the glacial-interglacial CO2 difference. The formation of these waters around Antarctica involves brine rejection over the continental shelves and is directly linked to changes in sea ice formation and Antarctic ice-sheet extent. Using this new scenario, we formulate a conceptual model that reproduce the succession and the amplitude of glaciations over the last few million years. This new mechanism furthermore provides the clue to understanding the changes in the main climatic frequency from 23 to 41 ka about 3 Myr ago and from 41 to 100 ka about 1 Myr ago. The Antarctic ice-sheet influence on bottom water formation could provide the "missing piece" to complete the astronomical theory of Quaternary climates. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A mechanism is proposed for the mid-Pleistocene transition from a dominant periodicity of 41 kyr to 100 kyr in glacial oscillations. The same mechanism is shown to also explain the asymmetry between the long glaciation and short deglaciation phases of each cycle since that transition versus the symmetry of the 41-kyr oscillations prior to the transition. These features arise naturally within the framework of the sea-ice switch glacial cycle mechanism of Gildor and Tziperman [2000] as a result of the gradual cooling of the deep ocean during the Pleistocene. This cooling results in a change of the relation between atmospheric temperature and the rates of accumulation and ablation of continentals ice sheets. It is this latter change that leads to the activation of the sea-ice switch and therefore to the initiation of the 100-kyr oscillations. The gradual glaciation and rapid deglaciations during these oscillations occur because the mean value of the ice sheet ablation is not far from the maximum rate of snow accumulation during warm periods. This proximity of mean ablation and maximum accumulation rates is shown to be also a consequence of the mid-Pleistocene gradual cooling of the deep ocean.},

abstract = {The Earth's climate over the past million years has been characterized by a succession of cold and warm periods, known as glacial-interglacial cycles, with periodicities corresponding to those of the Earth's main orbital parameters; precession (23 kyr), obliquity (41 kyr) and eccentricity (100 kyr). The astronomical theory of climate, in which the orbital variations are taken to drive the climate changes, has been very successful in explaining many features of the palaeoclimate records. Nevertheless, the timing of the main glacial and interglacial periods remains puzzling in many respects. In particular, the main glacial-interglacial switches occur approximately every 100 kyr, but the changes in insolation forcing are very small in this frequency band. Similarly, an especially warm interglacial episode, about 400,000 years ago, occurred at a time when insolation variations were minimal. Here I propose that multiple equilibria in the climate system can provide a resolution of these problems within the framework of astronomical theory. I present two simple models that successfully simulate each glacial- interglacial cycle over the late Pleistocene epoch at the correct time and with approximately the correct amplitude. Moreover, in a simulation over the past 2 million years, the onset of the observed prominent {\textasciitilde}100-kyr cycles around 0.8 to 1 million years ago is correctly reproduced.},

abstract = {It has been noted that several distinct modes of glacial oscillation have existed during the past few million years, ranging from low-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations in the early Pliocene, through relatively high amplitude, predominantly near-40 ky period, oscillations in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, to the major near-100 ky period oscillations of the late Pleistocene. In addition to other plausible mechanisms suggested previously to explain aspects of this multirhythmic phenomenon, we now illustrate another possible contributor to this type of behavior based on the hypothesis that the slow-response climatic system is bistable and that two kinds of internal instability may be operative along with externally imposed forcing due to earth-orbital (Milankovitch) radiation changes and slow, tectonically-induced changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. These two instabilities have been discussed previously: one is due to positive feedback in the global carbon cycle leading to near-100 ky free oscillations of the ice sheets, and the other is due to the potential for ice-calving catastrophes associated with bedrock variations that can lead to oscillations of a period near 40 ky, independent of obliquity forcing. Within the framework of a dynamical model containing the possibility for these two instabilities, as well as for stable modes, we show (1) how Milankovitch radiative changes or stochastic forcing influencing ice sheets can induce aperiodic (chaotic) transitions between the possible stable and unstable modes, and more significantly, (2) how progressive, long-term, tectonically-induced, changes in carbon dioxide, acting in concert with earth-orbital radiative variations in high Northern Hemisphere latitudes, can force systematic transitions between the modes. Such systematic changes can result in an ice mass chronology for the past 5 My that is qualitatively similar to the observed record of global ice mass. In essence, we have constructed a minimum dynamical model of the late Cenozoic climatic changes, containing what are believed to be the main physical factors determining these changes: ice mass, bedrock depression, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, deep ocean thermohaline state, Milankovitch radiation forcing, and slow tectonically-induced carbon dioxide forcing. This model forms the basis for a coherent theory for the complex climatic events of this long period. {\textcopyright} 1993 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {A model developed recently for the long-term variations of global ice mass, carbon dioxide, and mean ocean temperature through the late Cenozoic is simplified by hypothesizing a new equation for the CO2 variations containing one less adjustable parameter, but retaining the essential physical content of the previous equation (including nonlinearity and the potential for instability). By assuming plausible time constants for the glacial ice mass and global mean ocean temperature, and setting the values of six adjustable parameters (rate constants), a solution for the last 5 My is obtained displaying many of the features observed over this period, including the transition to the near-100 ky major ice-age oscillations of the late Pleistocene. In obtaining this solution it is also assumed that variations in tectonic forcing lead to a reduction of the equilibrium CO2 concentration (perhaps due to increased weathering of rapidly uplifted mountain ranges over this period). As a consequence of this CO2 reduction, the model dynamical system can bifurcate to a free oscillatory ice-age regime that is under the "pacemaker" influence of earthorbital (Milankovitch) forcing. Expanded discussions are given of the surface temperature variations accompanying the evolution of ice, CO2, and ocean temperature, and of the bifurcation properties of the model from both mathematical and physical viewpoints. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.},
