Pseudocode-ish:

Step one: Create a selection of constants and derived constants with descriptive names names.
Step two: Create aliases for each of the constants and derived constants to write out things in terms of variable names given in the paper.
Step three: Create all of the sub-formulas stated in the paper using our aliases, and aliasing those as needed.
Step four: Create the main formulas stated in the paper using our collection of aliases
Step five: Substitute all of our aliases in the main formulas out for the values they represent
Step five and a half: Create a copy of the environment for archiving.
Step six: Set up an ode solver for our main formulas and run said ode solver
Step six and a half: Save the results of said ode to the same location of the copy of the environment for archiving.
